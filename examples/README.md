## Example district maps

This directory contains some example maps. Currently they are:

- california.png: A House redistricting of California. The difference in population between the most and least populated district is 1956, or 0.005%.
- california\_straight\_lines.png: An example of what is possible if we're allowed to cut across census blocks. The borders are nicely straight; however, the local search failed to converge so this doesn't respect the population constraint. It is thus intended mainly for illustrative purposes.
- colorado\_postprocessed.png: A House redistricting of Colorado, with map details added for clarity. The maximum-minimum population difference is 250, or 0.004%.
